# 🚀 Project Name: GitRepo Insight Chatbot

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a chatbot that analyzes a given GitHub repository URL and provides detailed answers about:
- The structure of the repository
- The purpose of the project
- The code flow and logic
- The role and functionality of each file

It serves as an assistant tool for developers, students, and researchers to understand unfamiliar GitHub projects quickly and intuitively.
